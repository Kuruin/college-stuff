Build a full-stack web application called "Cloud-Based Event & Media Sharing Platform".

IMPORTANT SECURITY RULE:
- This is a PRIVATE application.
- There must be NO public access.
- Without authentication, NO user should be able to see events, photos, videos, or downloads.
- Without admin approval, a user must NOT be able to access any part of the system.

AUTHENTICATION & AUTHORIZATION:
1. Admin Authentication:
   - Create a single admin account using environment variables (ADMIN_EMAIL, ADMIN_PASSWORD).
   - Admin must log in to manage the platform.

2. User Access Control:
   - Users cannot freely self-register.
   - Admin creates user accounts OR approves pending users.
   - Only admin-approved users can log in.
   - Unapproved users must see "Access Denied – Not Authorized".

FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:

1. Admin Features:
   - Create, update, and delete upcoming events (title, description, date).
   - Upload photos and videos for any event.
   - View all users and approve or block them.
   - Delete events or uploaded media.

2. Authorized User Features:
   - Log in only after admin approval.
   - View list of upcoming events.
   - View single event details.
   - View event photo/video gallery.
   - Upload photos/videos to existing events.
   - Download event photos and videos.

3. Unauthorized Behavior:
   - If not logged in → redirect to login page.
   - If logged in but not approved → show access denied page.
   - Protect all backend APIs using authentication and authorization middleware.

TECH STACK:
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Backend: Node.js with Express
- Database (DBaaS): MongoDB Atlas
- Storage as a Service: Cloud storage for photos/videos (Firebase Storage or equivalent)
- Security as a Service:
   - Authentication
   - Authorization
   - Role-Based Access Control (Admin/User)
   - Password hashing (bcrypt)
   - Environment variables
   - HTTPS (handled by Replit)
- Hosting (PaaS): Replit public cloud platform

PROJECT STRUCTURE:
- /public (HTML, CSS, JS)
- /routes
- /models
- /controllers
- /middleware (auth check, role check)
- server.js

CLOUD CONCEPT MAPPING (ADD COMMENTS IN CODE):
- IaaS: Cloud VM/container running the backend
- PaaS: Replit hosting platform
- DBaaS: MongoDB Atlas
- Storage as a Service: Cloud-based media storage
- Security as a Service: Authentication, authorization, RBAC, HTTPS

NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Clean and simple UI
- Proper error handling and validation
- Use environment variables for secrets
- Well-commented code explaining cloud service usage

OUTPUT:
- Generate complete runnable code
- Provide steps to run the application on Replit
- Explain how to configure environment variables
